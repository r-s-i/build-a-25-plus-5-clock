# Build a 25 + 5 Clock

A 25 + 5 Clock (pomodoro-like) timer built with React. It allows you to break your work into focused intervals separated by short breaks. It was made as part of taking the freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification.

Features

- Option to adjust the length of the work interval (default 25 minutes) and break interval (default 5 minutes)
- Displays a timer that counts down the work interval
- Whenever a period (session or break) ends, a simple sound file plays
- Option to pause ("start/stop") and reset the timer
